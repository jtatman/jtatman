- 👋 Hi, I’m @jtatman, a reformed system engineer who imagines he can code stuff, with a masters degree in machine learning. 
- 👀 I’m interested in python, large language models, complicated prompting strateties, philosophical chaining of models, machine learning ideas, and llms that can be run on basic hardware for small and medium size business use.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust. I prefer functional over objects. I'm working with private models spanning video, text, vision, and audio disciplines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python projects that need help, or anywhere else that needs documentation.
- 📫 How to reach me? @tatmantech, on twitter and slack.
